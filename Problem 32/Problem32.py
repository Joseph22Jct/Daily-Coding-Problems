# Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.

# This problem was asked by Jane Street.

# Suppose you are given a table of currency exchange rates, represented as a 2D array. 
# Determine whether there is a possible arbitrage: that is, whether there is some sequence of trades you can make, 
# starting with some amount A of any currency, so that you can end up with some amount greater than A of that currency.

# There are no transaction costs and you can trade fractional quantities

##Going to be working with a table that looks like this, where rows represent currency from and columns currency to

# [1, 1.2, 0.6]
# [0.8, 1, 1.3]
# [1.4, 0.7, 1]
