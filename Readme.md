Hello! Here I am showcasing the solutions I made for Daily Coding Problem, I do these problems for practice and better understanding of programming.

You will notice that some solutions are naive or slow compared to the optimal solution, however, those were my initial approaches before reading the actual solution and understanding what I did wrong or did right.

Very few problems do not have anything written on them, that's because I could not find a solution by myself and had to look up the solution.

I chose python because it's easier to write in.
